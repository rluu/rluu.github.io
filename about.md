### Who Am I ?

Hello!  I'm Ryan luu, a software engineer in the DC metro area, specializing in Java, Python and C++.  I have an interest in all things related to programming and software development.

My primary skillsets are:

- Backend development in Java.
- Application UI development with C++/Qt and PyQt.
- Scripting (Python, Bash, etc.)
- Linux and Unix OSes.

If you're interested in chatting with me about programming, technology, or any other related topic, please visit my [contact page]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) for a way to get in touch with me.



### This Website

#### Purpose

Why create this website?  What is its purpose?

- This is a blog for writing my thoughts on software-related topics.  Sometimes I stumble across a cool but relatively unknown software library and want to share it, or perhaps I am documenting interesting features of a new language I am exploring.  This is also a way to keep track of what I've encountered and learned, so the information can be easily referenced in the future.

- This site has a page to organize and make available various personal software projects I have worked on in my spare time.

- This is my foray into developing webpages with newer web technologies.  By this, I mean newer web programming and markup languages, libraries, tools, etc.
