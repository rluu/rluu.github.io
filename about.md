### This Website

#### Purpose

Why create this website?  What is its purpose?

- This is a place for me to write articles or blog posts related to my personal interests.  This may be a cool new software library I've come across and or perhaps an interesting feature of a new language I am exploring.  This is also a way to keep track of what I've encountered and learned, so the information can be easily referenced in the future.

- This site has a page with a list of personal software projects I have worked on in my spare time.

- This is my foray into developing webpages with newer web technologies.  By this, I mean newer web programming and markup languages, libraries, tools, etc.
